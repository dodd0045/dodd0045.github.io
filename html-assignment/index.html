 <h2> <em>About Me</em></h2>
            <p>My name is Ryan Dodd. I am 31 years old. I am creating a new life by starting a career in Interactive Media Design. I was born in Point Clair, Quebec, on August 19<sup>th</sup>, 1990. Both my parents moved to Canada From England to find new successful jobs. Middle child of two sisters. I was raised in Ontario, moving several times throughout my childhood. I didn't stay in one place for too long. I am proud to have spent 4 years in the Canadian Forces serving my country in 2013.  </p>
            <p>I have spent lots of time working on video production in high school. I love watching movies and seeing the different cinematic style shots and technology used. I enjoy working creatively to come up with new solutions to everyday problems. I hope this career will be a rewarding one using my inherent skills. I believe this path will give me purpose. </p>
            <p>The future is exciting where I am starting a new business. Here I can apply the knowledge and skills from the Interactive Media Design course and apply them to real-life situations and applications. It is very exciting to deal with the everyday challenges of understanding customer requirements and developing ideas to positively impact their business. Working collaboratively to mould ideas and develop some great creative material is what is driving me forward today.
