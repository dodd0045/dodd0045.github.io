 <h2> <em>About Me</em></h2>
    
        <p>My name is Ryan Dodd. I am 31 years old. I am creating a new life by starting a career in Interactive Media Design. I was born in Rigaud, Quebec, August 19<sup>th</sup> 1990. Both my parents moved to Canada From England to find a new successful jobs. Middle child of two sisters. I was raised in Ontario, moving several times throughout my childhood. I didn't stay in one place for too long. I am proud to have spent 4 years in the Canadian Forces serving my country in 2013. I learned to face my fears with courage.</p>

        <p>I have spent lots of time working on video production in high school. I love watching movies and seeing the different cinematic style shots and technology used. I enjoy working creatively to come up with new solutions to everyday problems. I hope this career will be a rewarding one using my inherent skills. I believe this path will give me purpose. </p>
        
        <p>There have been some ups and downs in my life, making me think about what matters most. We've all been in situations we wish we could change; although life moves on, we must accept our choices and move forward. My father always said <q>lifes like a book and you have to turn the page to get to a new chapter</q> Today I work very hard to keep myself busy working towards my professional endeavours. You know when you put in the effort, you will get the results. Nothing comes easy. </p>
